This code is a Streamlit app for transcribing audio files using the AssemblyAI transcription service. Let's break down the main components and their functionalities:

Imports:

streamlit is imported as st for creating the web application.
assemblyai is imported to interact with the AssemblyAI API.
os is imported for interacting with the operating system.
API Key:

The AssemblyAI API key is set using aai.settings.api_key.
Transcription Functions:

transcribe_audio(audio_path): Transcribes the audio file located at audio_path using the AssemblyAI service. It also sets a configuration for transcription, enabling speaker labels.
upload_audio_to_assemblyai(audio_path): This function is a placeholder. In a real scenario, it might upload the audio file to AssemblyAI, but in this code, it simply returns the provided audio_path.
format_timestamp(ms): Formats a timestamp from milliseconds to HH:MM
format.
Main Function (main(audio_path)):

Sets up directories for storing audio and text output.
Transcribes the audio using transcribe_audio.
Writes the transcription to a text file, including speaker labels and timestamps.
Saves the original and transcribed audio files to the respective directories.
Returns the transcription.
Main App Function (main_app()):

Creates a Streamlit app titled "Audio Transcription App".
Provides a file uploader for uploading audio files.
Displays the uploaded audio file.
When the "Transcribe" button is clicked, it triggers the transcription process, displays the transcription, and saves the transcribed text and audio files.
Conditional Execution:

if __name__ == "__main__":: This block ensures that main_app() is only executed if this script is run directly, not when it's imported as a module into another script.
Overall, this code creates a simple web application where users can upload audio files, transcribe them using AssemblyAI, and view the transcription along with speaker labels and timestamps.
